HttpAsyncClient Overview
========================

<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT: HttpAsyncClient 4 is at End of Life and is no longer being developed or supported. 
The users of HttpAsyncClient 4 4 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to HttpClient 5.</span>

The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant protocol used on the Internet today. Web
services, network-enabled appliances and the growth of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP
protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, while increasing the number of applications that require HTTP support.

Although the java.net package provides basic functionality for accessing resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full
flexibility or functionality needed by many applications. HttpAsyncClient seeks to fill this void by providing an
efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the most recent HTTP standards and
recommendations.

Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP protocol, HttpAsyncClient may be of interest to
anyone building HTTP-aware client applications based on asynchronous, event driven I/O model.

Documentation
-------------

1. [Quick Start](quickstart.md) - contains a simple, complete example of asynchronous request execution.
1. [HttpAsyncClient Examples](examples.md) - a set of examples demonstrating some of the more complex use scenarios.
1. Javadocs
    - [HttpAsyncClient](./current/httpasyncclient/apidocs/)
    - [HttpAsyncClient Cache](./current/httpasyncclient-cache/apidocs/)

Features
--------

- Standards based, pure Java, implementation of HTTP versions 1.0 and 1.1
- Full implementation of all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE) in an extensible OO
  framework.
- Supports encryption with HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) protocol.
- Transparent connections through HTTP proxies.
- Tunneled HTTPS connections through HTTP proxies, via the CONNECT method.
- Connection management support concurrent request execution. Supports setting the maximum total connections as well as
  the maximum connections per host. Detects and closes expired connections.
- Persistent connections using KeepAlive in HTTP/1.0 and persistence in HTTP/1.1
- The ability to set connection timeouts.
- Source code is freely available under the Apache License.
- Basic, Digest, NTLMv1, NTLMv2, NTLM2 Session, SNPNEGO and Kerberos authentication schemes.
- Plug-in mechanism for custom authentication schemes.
- Automatic Cookie handling for reading Set-Cookie: headers from the server and sending them back out in a `Cookie`
  header when appropriate.
- Plug-in mechanism for custom cookie policies.
- Support for HTTP/1.1 response caching.
- Support for pipelined request execution and processing.

Standards Compliance
