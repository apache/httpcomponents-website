HttpAsyncClient Examples
========================

- [Asynchronous HTTP exchange](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientHttpExchange.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates a basic asynchronous HTTP request / response exchange. Response content is buffered in
  memory for simplicity.

- [Asynchronous HTTP exchange with content streaming](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientHttpExchangeStreaming.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates an asynchronous HTTP request / response exchange with a full content streaming.

- [Concurrent asynchronous HTTP exchanges](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientHttpExchangeFutureCallback.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates a fully asynchronous execution of multiple HTTP exchanges where the result of an individual
  operation is reported using a callback interface.

- [Pipelined HTTP exchanges](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientPipelined.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates a pipelined execution of multiple HTTP request / response exchanges. Response content is
  buffered in memory for simplicity.

- [Pipelined HTTP exchanges with content streaming](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientPipelinedStreaming.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates a pipelined execution of multiple HTTP request / response exchanges with a full content
  streaming.

- [Asynchronous request via a proxy](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientExecuteProxy.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates how to send an HTTP request via a proxy.

- [HttpAsyncClient configuration](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientConfiguration.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates how to customize and configure the most common aspects of HTTP request execution and
  connection management.

- [Custom execution context](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientCustomContext.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates the use of a local execution context with custom context settings.

- [Client authentication](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientAuthentication.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates execution of an HTTP request against a target site that requires user authentication.

- [Proxy authentication](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientProxyAuthentication.java?view=markup)

  This example shows execution of an HTTP request over a secure connection tunneled through an authenticating proxy.

- [Custom SSL context](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientCustomSSL.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates how to create secure connections with a custom SSL context.

- [Zero copy file upload / download](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/ZeroCopyHttpExchange.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates how HttpAsyncClient can be used to upload or download files without creating an intermediate
  content buffer in memory (zero copy file transfer).

- [Connection eviction](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/httpasyncclient/branches/4.1.x/httpasyncclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/client/AsyncClientEvictExpiredConnections.java?view=markup)

  This example demonstrates how to evict expired and idle connections from the connection pool.
