HttpCore Overview
=================

<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT: HttpCore 4 is at End of Life and is no longer being developed or supported. 
The users of HttpCore 4 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to HttpCore 5.</span>

HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used to build custom client and server side HTTP
services with a minimal footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models: blocking I/O model based on the classic Java I/O
and non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.
