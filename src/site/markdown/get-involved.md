  and [apache/httpcomponents-client](https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/) and use this to follow

Contributing
------------

HttpComponents is a community-led project, and we are delighted to receive contributions of anything from minor fixes to
new features. If you have an itch to scratch, then by all means do that! Fixing bugs you run into, or adding features
you need, are both immensely helpful. There are plenty of ways to help outside writing code. Code review of pull
requests (even if you are not a committer), feature suggestions, reporting bugs, documentation and usability feedback
all matter immensely.

The best way to get involved with the project and potentially to make the first step toward becoming a project committer
is to look at the open issues in JIRA and help resolve them. Open issues labelled `volunteers-wanted` are especially
unlikely to get resolved without help from volunteers / external contributors.

Here is the list of [HttpComponents Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12350197) that HttpComponents
project members require a helping hand with.

Testing
-------

All Pull Requests are automatically tested on [Travis CI (Core)](https://travis-ci.com/apache/httpcomponents-core)
, [Travis CI (Client)](https://travis-ci.com/apache/httpcomponents-client) on both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

More information
----------------

As it happens, the ways to get involved into an open source project are basically the same for all projects. Please have
a look at the [Incubator Guide To Participation](https://incubator.apache.org/guides/participation.html). It's terse, but
has pointers to additional information elsewhere at Apache. The sections on participating as a User and as a Developer
apply here, too.
