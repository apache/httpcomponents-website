HttpCore Examples

    * {{{./httpcore5/examples/ClassicGetExecutionExample.java} 
    Classic (blocking) HTTP/1.1 GET requests}}
    
    This example demonstrates synchronous execution of multiple HTTP/1.1 GET requests.

    * {{{./httpcore5/examples/ClassicPostExecutionExample.java} 
    Classic (blocking) HTTP/1.1 POST requests}}
    
    This example demonstrates synchronous execution of multiple HTTP/1.1 POST requests with enclosed 
    content of various types.  

    * {{{./httpcore5/examples/AsyncRequestExecutionExample.java} 
    Asynchronous HTTP/1.1 GET requests}}

    on Java 1.7 and Java 1.8.

    * {{{./httpcore5/examples/AsyncPipelinedRequestExecutionExample.java}
    Asynchronous HTTP/1.1 GET requests with message pipelining}}
    
    This example demonstrates asynchronous, pipelined execution multiple HTTP/1.1 requests.

    * {{{./httpcore5-h2/examples/Http2MultiStreamExecutionExample.java} 
    Asynchronous HTTP/2 GET requests with multiple concurrent streams}}
    
    This example demonstrates asynchronous, multistream execution of multiple HTTP/2 requests.

    * {{{./httpcore5/examples/ClassicFileServerExample.java} 
    Classic (blocking) HTTP/1.1 file server}}
